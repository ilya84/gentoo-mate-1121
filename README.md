MATE-DESKTOP 1.12.1
===================

This is an overlay intended to be used in Gentoo. It is based
on packages by gentoo upstream Maintainer (NP-Completeass), pacakges
by Alex (from the now gone open-overlay) and packages by OzTiram.

I did my best to test all ebuilds (with `repoman` and with installing
   them on my machine), but I could not possibly test all use flags.

  - I didn't try bluetooth support
  - I don't use systemd, hence I didn't test it

I would be happy to see any feedback or bugs here:
